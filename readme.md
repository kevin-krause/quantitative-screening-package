# Quantitative Trading Finance Model

## Overview

This repository contains a finance model for quantitative trading. The model utilizes a Python-based approach to analyze trading strategies, assess performance, and generate insights for decision-making. By leveraging this finance model, you can evaluate the performance of various trading strategies against historical data and assess their potential profitability.

## Getting Started

To get started with this finance model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevin-krause/quantitative-trading-model.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Running the Model:**
- Open the Python script (`main.py`) and make any necessary adjustments to your trading strategies and configurations.
- Run the script to analyze your strategies and generate insights.

## Usage

### Model Configuration

Before running the model, you can customize it by modifying the Python script (`main.py`). You can define your trading strategies, specify the initial balance, and configure other parameters according to your specific requirements.

### Running the Model

1. Execute the Python script:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. The model will analyze your trading strategies, calculate final balances, and generate insights.

3. The results will be printed in the console and saved in an Excel file named `model.xlsx`.

### Interpreting the Results

The model provides the following information for each trading strategy:

- Strategy Identifier
- Initial Balance
- Final Balance
- Percentage Return

This data can help you assess the performance of different trading strategies and make informed decisions regarding their profitability.

## Example

Here's an example of what you might see when you run the model:
```bash
Strategy: Strategy_A
Initial Balance: 100,000.00
Final Balance: 120,500.75
Percentage Return: 20.5%
```
